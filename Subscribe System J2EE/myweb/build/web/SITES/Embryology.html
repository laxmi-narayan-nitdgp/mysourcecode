        <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p><center> 
A few years ago a group of Arabs collected all information concerning
embryology from the Qur’aan, and followed the instruction of the Qur’aan: <br/>
<b>“If ye realise this not, ask Of those who possess the Message.” [Al-
Qur’aan 16:43 & 21:7]</b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
All the information from the Qur’aan so gathered, was translated into English
and presented to Prof. (Dr.) Keith Moore, who was the Professor of
Embryology and Chairman of the Department of Anatomy at the University
of Toronto, in Canada. At present he is one of the highest authorities in the
field of Embryology. He was asked to give his opinion regarding the
information present in the Qur’aan concerning the field of embryology. After
carefully examining the translation of the Qur’aanic verses presented to him,
Dr. Moore said that most of the information concerning embryology
mentioned in the Qur’aan is in perfect conformity with modern discoveries in
the field of embryology and does not conflict with them in any way. He added
that there were however a few verses, on whose scientific accuracy he could
not comment. He could not say whether the statements were true or false,
since he himself was not aware of the information contained therein.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        There was also no mention of this information in modern writings and studies
on embryology.</br> One such verse is: </br>

<b>“Proclaim! (or Read!) In the name Of
thy Lord and Cherisher, Who created – Created man, out of A (mere)
clot Of congealed blood.” [Al-Qur’aan 96:1-2]</b>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                The word <i><b>ALAQ</b></i> besides meaning a congealed clot of blood also means
something that clings, a leech-like substance. Dr. Keith Moore had no
knowledge whether an embryo in the initial stages appears like a leech. To
check this out he studied the initial stage of the embryo under a very powerful
microscope in his laboratory and compared what he observed with a diagram
of a leech and he was astonished at the striking resemblance between the two!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
In the same manner, he acquired more information on embryology that was
hitherto not known to him, from the Qur’aan. Dr. Keith Moore answered
about eighty questions dealing with embryological data mentioned in the
Qur’aan and Hadith. Noting that the information contained in the Qur’aan and
Hadith was in full agreement with the latest discoveries in the field of
embryology, Prof. Moore said, “If I was asked these questions thirty years
ago, I would not have been able to answer half of them for lack of scientific
information”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Dr. Keith Moore had earlier authored the book, ‘The Developing Human’.
After acquiring new knowledge from the Qur’aan, he wrote, in 1982, the 3rd
edition of the same book, ‘The Developing Human’. The book was the
recipient of an award for the best medical book written by a single author.
This book has been translated into several major languages of the world and
is used as a textbook of embryology in the first year of medical studies.
In 1981, during the Seventh Medical Conference in Dammam, Saudi Arabia,
Dr. Moore said, “It has been a great pleasure for me to help clarify statements
in the Qur’aan about human development. It is clear to me that these
statements must have come to Muhammad from God or Allah, because
almost all of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later.
This proves to me that Muhammad must have been a messenger of God or
Allah.” 12
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson, Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology, at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, U.S.A.,
proclaims: “...these Hadiths, sayings of Muhammad (pbuh) could not have
been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that was available at
the time of the writer (7th century). It follows that not only is there no conflict
between genetics and religion (Islam) but in fact religion (Islam) may guide
science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scientific
approaches… there exist statements in the Qur’aan shown centuries later to
be valid which support knowledge in the Qur’aan having been derived from
God.”

        <p>&nbsp;  </p>

<b>“Now let man but think From what he is created! He is created from A
drop emitted – Proceeding from between The back bone and the ribs.”
[Al-Qur’aan 86:5-7] </b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
In embryonic stages, the reproductive organs of the male and female, i.e. the
testicles and the ovaries, begin their development near the kidney between the
spinal column and the eleventh and twelfth ribs. Later they descend; the
female gonads (ovaries) stop in the pelvis while the male gonads (testicles)
continue their descent before birth to reach the scrotum through the inguinal
canal. Even in the adult after the descent of the reproductive organ, these
organs receive their nerve supply and blood supply from the Abdominal
Aorta, which is in the area between the backbone (spinal column) and the
ribs. Even the lymphatic drainage and the venous return goes to the same
area.

<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">(Minute Quantity of Liquid)</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;  </p>
       <p><center> 
The Glorious Qur’aan mentions no less than eleven times that the human
being is created from nutfah, which means a minute quantity of liquid or a
trickle of liquid which remains after emptying a cup. <p>&nbsp;  </p> <b> This is mentioned in
several verses of the Qur’aan including 22:5 and 23:13. 13 </b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
Science has confirmed in recent times that only one out of an average of three
million sperms is required for fertilising the ovum. This means that only a
1/three millionth part or 0.00003% of the quantity of sperms that are emitted
is required for fertilisation.

       <p><center> 
<b>“And made his progeny From a quintessence Of the nature of A fluid
despised.” [Al-Qur’aan 32:8] </b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
The Arabic word sulâlah means quintessence or the best part of a whole. We
have come to know now that only one single spermatozoon that penetrates the
ovum is required for fertilization, out of the several millions produced by
man. That one spermatozoon out of several millions, is referred to in the
Qur’aan as sulâlah. Sulâlah also means gentle extraction from a fluid. The
fluid refers to both male and female germinal fluids containing gametes. Both
ovum and sperm are gently extracted from their environments in the process
of fertilization.

        <p>&nbsp;  </p>
       <p><center> 
Consider the following Qur’aanic verse: <b> “Verily We created Man from a
drop Of mingled sperm.” [Al-Qur’aan 76:2] </b> <br/>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
The Arabic word nutfatin amshaajin means mingled liquids. According to
some commentators of the Qur’aan, mingled liquids refers to the male or
female agents or liquids. After mixture of male and female gamete, the zygote
still remains nutfah. Mingled liquids can also refer to spermatic fluid that is
formed of various secretions that come from various glands.
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
Therefore nutfatin amsaj, i.e. a minute quantity of mingled fluids refers to the
male and female gametes (germinal fluids or cells) and part of the
surrounding fluids.

<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">SEX DETERMINATION</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;  </p>
       <p><center> 
The sex of a fetus is determined by the nature of the sperm and not the ovum.
The sex of the child, whether female or male, depends on whether the 23rd
pair of chromosomes is XX or XY respectively. Primarily sex determination
occurs at fertilization and depends upon the type of sex chromosome in the
sperm that fertilizes an ovum. If it is an ‘X’ bearing sperm that fertilizes the
ovum, the fetus is a female and if it is a ‘Y’ bearing sperm then the fetus is a
male. <br/>
<b>“That He did create In pairs – male and female, From a seed when
lodged (In its place).” [Al-Qur’aan 53:45-46] </b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
The Arabic word nutfah means a minute quantity of liquid and tumnâ means
ejaculated or planted. Therefore nutfah specifically refers to sperm because it
is ejaculated. The Qur’aan says: “Was he not a drop of sperm emitted (In
lowly form)? “Then did he become A clinging clot; Then did (Allah)
make And fashion (him) In due proportion. <br/>
<b>“And of him He made Two sexes, male And female.” [Al-Qur’aan 75:37-39] </b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
Here again it is mentioned that a small quantity (drop) of sperm (indicated by
the word nutfatan min maniyyin) which comes from the man is responsible
for the sex of the fetus.
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
Mothers-in-law in the Indian subcontinent, by and large prefer having male
grandchildren and often blame their daughters-in-law if the child is not of the
desired sex. If only they knew that the determining factor is the nature of the
male sperm and not the female ovum! If they were to blame anybody, they
should blame their sons and not their daughters-in-law since both the Qur’aan
and Science hold that it is the male fluid that is responsible for the sex of the
child!

<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">FOETUS PROTECTED BY THREE VEILS OF DARKNESS</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;  </p>
       <p><center>
       <b>“He makes you, In the wombs of your mothers, In stages, one after
another, In three veils of darkness.” [Al-Qur’aan 39:6]</b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
According to Prof. Keith Moore these three veils of darkness in the Qur’aan
refer to:
(i) anterior abdominal wall of the mother
(ii) the uterine wall
(iii) the amnio-chorionic membrane.

       <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">EMBRYONIC STAGES</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;  </p>
       <p><center>
      <b> “Man We did create From a quintessence (of clay); Then We placed him
As (a drop of) sperm In a place of rest, firmly fixed; Then We made the
sperm Into a clot of congealed blood; Then of that clot We made A
(foetus) lump; then We Made out of that lump Bones and clothed the
bones With flesh; then We developed Out of it another creature. So
blessed be Allah, The Best to create!” [Al-Qur’aan 23:12-14]</b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
In this verse Allah states that man is created from a small quantity of liquid
which is placed in a place of rest, firmly fixed (well established or lodged) for
which the Arabic word qarârin makîn is used.
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
The uterus is well protected from the posterior by the spinal column
supported firmly by the back muscles. The embryo is further protected by the
amniotic sac containing the amniotic fluid. Thus the foetus has a well
protected dwelling place. This small quantity of fluid is made into alaqah,
meaning something which clings. It also means a leech-like substance. Both
descriptions are scientifically acceptable as in the very early stages the foetus
clings to the wall and also appears to resemble the leech in shape. It also
behaves like a leech (blood sucker) and acquires its blood supply from the mother through
the placenta. The third meaning of the word alaqah is a blood clot. During
this alaqah stage, which spans the third and fourth week of pregnancy, the
blood clots within closed vessels. Hence the embryo acquires the appearance
of a blood clot in addition to acquiring the appearance of a leech. In 1677,
Hamm and Leeuwenhoek were the first scientists to observe human sperm
cells (spermatozoa) using a microscope. They thought that a sperm cell
contained a miniature human being which grew in the uterus to form a
newborn. This was known as the perforation theory. When scientists
discovered that the ovum was bigger than the sperm, it was thought by De
Graf and others that the foetus existed in a miniature form in the ovum. Later,
in the 18th century Maupertuis propagated the theory of biparental
inheritance. The alaqah is transformed into mudghah which means
‘something that is chewed (having teeth marks)’ and also something that is
tacky and small which can be put in the mouth like gum. Both these
explanations are scientifically correct. Prof. Keith Moore took a piece of
plaster seal and made it into the size and shape of the early stage of foetus and
chewed it between the teeth to make it into a ‘Mudgha’. He compared this
with the photographs of the early stage of foetus. The teeth marks resembled
the ‘somites’ which is the early formation of the spinal column.
This mudghah is transformed into bones (izâm). The bones are clothed with
intact flesh or muscles (lahm). Then Allah makes it into another creature.
Prof. Marshall Johnson is one of the leading scientists in US, and is the head
of the Department of Anatomy and Director of the Daniel Institute at the
Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia in US. He was asked to
comment on the verses of the Qur’aan dealing with embryology. He said that
the verses of the Qur’aan describing the embryological stages cannot be a
coincidence. He said it was probable that Muhammad (pbuh) had a powerful
microscope. On being reminded that the Qur’aan was revealed 1400 years
ago, and microscopes were invented centuries after the time of Prophet
Muhammad (pbuh), Prof. Johnson laughed and admitted that the first
microscope invented could not magnify more than 10 times and could not
show a clear picture. Later he said: “I see nothing here in conflict with the
concept that Divine intervention was involved when Muhammad (pbuh)
recited the Qur’aan.”
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
According to Dr. Keith Moore, the modern classification of embryonic
development stages which is adopted throughout the world, is not easily
comprehensible, since it identifies stages on a numerical basis i.e. stage I,
stage II, etc. The divisions revealed in the Qur’aan are based on distinct and
easily identifiable forms or shapes, which the embryo passes through. These
are based on different phases of prenatal development and provide elegant
scientific descriptions that are comprehensible and practical.
Similar embryological stages of human development have been described in
the following verses: <br/>
<b> “Was he not a drop Of sperm emitted (In lowly
form)? Then did he become a clinging clot; Then did (Allah) make and
fashion (him) In due proportion. And of him He made Two sexes, male
and female.” [Al-Qur’aan 75:37-39] </b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<b>
“Him Who created thee, fashioned thee in due proportion, And gave thee
a just bias; In whatever Form He wills, Does He put thee together.” [Al-
Qur’aan 82:7-8] </b></center></p></div>

       <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">EMBRYO PARTLY FORMED AND PARTLY UNFORMED</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;  </p>
       <p><center>
       At the mugdhah stage, if an incision is made in the embryo and the internal
organ is dissected, it will be seen that most of them are formed while the
others are not yet completely formed.
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
According to Prof. Johnson, if we describe the embryo as a complete creation,
then we are only describing that part which is already created. If we describe
it as an incomplete creation, then we are only describing that part which is not
yet created. So, is it a complete creation or an incomplete creation? There is
no better description of this stage of embryogenesis than the Qur’aanic
description, “partly formed and partly unformed”, as in the following verse: <br/>
<b>“We created you Out of dust, then out of Sperm, then out of a leech-like
Clot, then out of a morsel Of flesh, partly formed And partly unformed.”
[Al-Qur’aan 22:5] </b> 
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
Scientifically we know that at this early stage of development there are some
cells which are differentiated and there are some cells that are
undifferentiated – some organs are formed and yet others unformed.

<div class="tempaltemo_content_left_section_01">
<h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">SENSE OF HEARING AND SIGHTD</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;  </p>
       <p><center>
       The first sense to develop in a developing human embryo is hearing. The
foetus can hear sounds after the 24th week. Subsequently, the sense of sight is
developed and by the 28th week, the retina becomes sensitive to light.
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
Consider the following Qur’aanic verses related to the development of the
senses in the embryo: <br/><b> “And He gave You (the faculties of) hearing and
sight and feeling (And understanding).” [Al-Qur’aan 32:9]
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
“Verily We created Man from a drop Of mingled sperm, In order to try
him: So We gave him (the gifts), Of Hearing and Sight.” [Al-Qur’aan
76:2]
“It is He Who has created For you (the faculties of) Hearing, sight,
feeling And understanding: little thanks It is ye give!” [Al-Qur’aan 23:78]</b>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
In all these verses the sense of hearing is mentioned before that of sight. Thus
the Qur’aanic description matches with the discoveries in modern
embryology.
