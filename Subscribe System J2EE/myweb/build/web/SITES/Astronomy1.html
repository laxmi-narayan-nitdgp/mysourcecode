          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE: ‘THE BIG BANG’ </h2>
&nbsp;
<p>The creation of the universe is explained by astrophysicists in a widely
  accepted phenomenon, popularly known as the ‘Big Bang’. It is supported by
  observational and experimental data gathered by astronomers and
  astrophysicists for decades. According to the ‘Big Bang’, the whole universe
  was initially one big mass (Primary Nebula). Then there was a ‘Big Bang’
  (Secondary Separation) which resulted in the formation of Galaxies. These
  then divided to form stars, planets, the sun, the moon, etc. The origin of the
  universe was unique and the probability of it occurring by ‘chance’ is zero.
  The Qur’aan contains the following verse, regarding the origin of the
  universe: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i> &quot;Do not the Unbelievers see That the heavens and the earth
Were joined together (as one Unit of Creation), before We clove them
asunder?” [Al-Qur’aan 21:30]</i></b>
</p>
<b>
<center>
  The striking congruence between the Qur’aanic verse and the ‘Big Bang’ is
  inescapable! How could a book, which first appeared in the deserts of Arabia
  1400 years ago, contain this profound scientific truth?
</center>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="tempaltemo_content_left_section_01">
          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">THERE WAS AN INITIAL GASEOUS MASS BEFORE THE </h2>
           <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">CREATION OF GALAXIES </h2>
           <p><center>Scientists say that before the galaxies in the universe were formed, celestial
matter was initially in the form of gaseous matter. In short, huge gaseous
matter or clouds were present before the formation of the galaxies. To
describe initial celestial matter, the word ‘smoke’ is more appropriate than
gas. The following Qur’aanic verse refers to this state of the universe by the
word dhukhan which means smoke.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>“Moreover, He Comprehended In His design the sky, And it had been
(as) smoke: He said to it And to the earth: ‘Come ye together, Willingly

or unwillingly.’ They said: ‘We do come (Together), in willing
obedience.’” [Al-Qur’aan 41:11]</b>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
Again, this fact is a corollary to the ‘Big Bang’ and was not known to the
Arabs during the time of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). What then, could have
been the source of this knowledge?</center></p>

          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">THE SPHERICAL SHAPE OF THE EARTH</h2>
          <p><center>In early times, people believed that the earth is flat. For centuries, men were
afraid to venture out too far, lest they should fall off the edge. Sir Francis
Drake was the first person who proved that the earth is spherical when he
sailed around it in 1597. Consider the following Qur’aanic verse regarding
the alternation of day and night: <b>“Seest thou not that Allah merges Night
into Day And He merges Day into Night?” [Al-Qur’aan 31:29]</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Merging here means that the night slowly and gradually changes to day and
vice versa. This phenomenon can only take place if the earth is spherical. If
the earth was flat, there would have been a sudden change from night to day
and from day to night.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The following verse also alludes to the spherical shape of the earth: <b>“He
created the heavens And the earth In true (proportions): He makes the
Night Overlap the Day, and the Day Overlap the Night.” [Al-Qur’aan
39:5]</b>
The Arabic word used here is<i><b> Kawwara</b></i> meaning ‘to overlap’ or ‘to coil’– the
way a turban is wound around the head. The overlapping or coiling of the day
and night can only take place if the earth is spherical.
The earth is not exactly round like a ball, but geo-spherical i.e. it is flattened
at the poles. The following verse contains a description of the earth’s shape:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>“And the earth, moreover, Hath He made egg shaped.” 2 [Al-Qur’aan
79:30] </b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Arabic word for egg here is <i><b>dahaha</b></i>, which means an ostrich-egg. The
shape of an ostrich-egg resembles the geo-spherical shape of the earth. Thus
the Qur’aan correctly describes the shape of the earth, though the prevalent
notion when the Qur’aan was revealed was that the earth is flat.

<div class="tempaltemo_content_left_section_01">
          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">THE LIGHT OF THE MOON IS REFLECTED LIGHT</h2>
          <p><center>It was believed by earlier civilizations that the moon emanates its own light.
Science now tells us that the light of the moon is reflected light. However this
fact was mentioned in the Qur’aan 1,400 years ago in the following verse:. </br>
<b>
“Blessed is He Who made Constellations in the skies, And placed therein
a Lamp And a Moon giving light.” [Al-Qur’aan 25:61] </b> </br>
The Arabic word for the sun in the Qur’aan, is shams. It is referred to as
siraaj, which means a ‘torch’ or as wahhaaj which means ‘a blazing lamp’ or
as diya which means ‘shining glory’. All three descriptions are appropriate to
the sun, since it generates intense heat and light by its internal combustion.
The Arabic word for the moon is qamar and it is described in the Qur’aan as
muneer, which is a body that gives nur i.e. light. Again, the Qur’aanic
description matches perfectly with the true nature of the moon, which does
not give off light itself and is an inert body that reflects the light of the sun.
Not once in the Qur’aan, is the moon mentioned as siraaj, wahhaaj or diya or
the sun as nur or muneer. This implies that the Qur’aan recognizes the
difference between the nature of sunlight and moonlight.</br>
Consider the following verses related to the nature of light from the sun and
the moon: </br>
<b>“It is He who made the sun To be a shining glory And the
moon to be a light (Of beauty).” [Al-Qur’aan 10:5] </br>
“See ye not How Allah has created The seven heavens One above
another, “And made the moon A light in their midst, and made the sun
As a (Glorious) Lamp?” [Al-Qur’aan 71:15-16] </b></center> </p>

          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">THE SUN ROTATES</h2>
          
<p><center>
For a long time European philosophers and scientists believed that the earth
stood still in the centre of the universe and every other body including the sun
moved around it. In the West, this geocentric concept of the universe was
prevalent right from the time of Ptolemy in the second century B.C. In 1512,
Nicholas Copernicus put forward his Heliocentric Theory of Planetary
Motion, which asserted that the sun is motionless at the centre of the solar
system with the planets revolving around it. <p>&nbsp;</p>
In 1609, the German scientist Yohannus Keppler published the ‘Astronomia
Nova’. In this he concluded that not only do the planets move in elliptical
orbits around the sun, they also rotate upon their axes at irregular speeds.
With this knowledge it became possible for European scientists to explain
correctly many of the mechanisms of the solar system including the sequence
of night and day.<p>&nbsp;</p>
After these discoveries, it was thought that the Sun was stationary and did not
rotate about its axis like the Earth. I remember having studied this fallacy
from Geography books during my school days. Consider the following
Qur’aanic verse: <b>“It is He Who created The Night and the Day, And the
sun and the moon: All (the celestial bodies) Swim along, each in its
Rounded course.” [Al-Qur’aan 21:33]</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
The Arabic word used in the above verse is yasbahûn . The word yasbahûn is
derived from the word sabaha. It carries with it the idea of motion that comes
from any moving body. If you use the word for a man on the ground, it would
not mean that he is rolling but would mean he is walking or running. If you
use the word for a man in water it would not mean that he is floating but
would mean that he is swimming. <p>&nbsp;</p>
Similarly, if you use the word yasbah for a celestial body such as the sun it
would not mean that it is only flying through space but would mean that it is
also rotating as it goes through space. Most of the school textbooks have
incorporated the fact that the sun rotates about its axis. The rotation of the sun
about its own axis can be proved with the help of an equipment that projects
the image of the sun on the table top so that one can examine the image of the
sun without being blinded. It is noticed that the sun has spots which complete
a circular motion once every 25 days i.e. the sun takes approximately 25 days
to rotate around its axis.<p>&nbsp;</p>
In fact, the sun travels through space at roughly 150 miles per second, and
takes about 200 million years to complete one revolution around the center of
our Milky Way Galaxy.
<p>&nbsp;</p><b>
“It is not permitted To the Sun to catch up The Moon, nor can The Night
outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along In (its own) orbit (According to
Law).” [Al-Qur’aan 36:40]</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
This verse mentions an essential fact discovered by modern astronomy, i.e.
the existence of the individual orbits of the Sun and the Moon, and their
journey through space with their own motion. The ‘fixed place’ towards,
which the sun travels, carrying with it the solar system, has been located
exactly by modern astronomy. It has been given a name, the Solar Apex. The
solar system is indeed moving in space towards a point situated in the
constellation of Hercules (alpha Layer) whose exact location is firmly
established.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The moon rotates around its axis in the same duration that it takes to revolve
around the earth. It takes approximately 29½ days to complete one rotation.
One cannot help but be amazed at the scientific accuracy of the Qur’aanic
verses. Should we not ponder over the question: “What was the source of
knowledge contained in the Qur’aan?” </center></p>

          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">THE SUN WILL EXTINGUISH AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD</h2>
          <p><center>The light of the sun is due to a chemical process on its surface that has been
taking place continuously for the past five billion years. It will come to an end
at some point of time in the future when the sun will be totally extinguished
leading to extinction of all life on earth. Regarding the impermanence of the
sun’s existence the Qur’aan says: 
<p>&nbsp;</p><b>“And the Sun Runs its course For a
period determined For it; that is The decree of (Him) The exalted in
Might, The All-Knowing.” [Al-Qur’aan 36:38] 3 </b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Arabic word used here is mustaqarr, which means a place or time that is
determined. Thus the Qur’aan says that the sun runs towards a determined
place, and will do so only up to a pre-determined period of time – meaning
that it will end or extinguish.</center></p>

          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">THE PRESENCE OF INTERSTELLAR MATTER</h2>
          <p><center>Space outside organized astronomical systems was earlier assumed to be a
vacuum . Astrophysicists later discovered the presence of bridges of matter in
this interstellar space. These bridges of matter are called plasma, and consist
of completely ionized gas containing equal number of free electrons and
positive ions. Plasma is sometimes called the fourth state of matter (besides
the three known states viz. solid, liquid and gas). The Qur’aan mentions the
presence of this interstellar material in the following verse: 
<p>&nbsp;</p><b>“He Who created
the heavens And the earth and all That is between.” [Al-Qur’aan 25:59]</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
It would be ridiculous, for anybody to even suggest that the presence of
interstellar galactic material was known 1400 years ago.</center></p>

          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE</h2>
          
<p><center>
In 1925, an American astronomer by the name of Edwin Hubble, provided
observational evidence that all galaxies are receding from one another, which
implies that the universe is expanding. The expansion of the universe is now
an established scientific fact. This is what Al-Qur’aan says regarding the
nature of the universe: “With the power and skill Did We construct The
Firmament: 
<p>&nbsp;</p><b>For it is We Who create The vastness of Space.” [Al-Qur’aan
51:47]</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Arabic word mûsi‘ûn is correctly translated as ‘expanding it’, and it
refers to the creation of the expanding vastness of the universe. Stephen
Hawking, in his book, ‘A Brief History of Time’, says, “The discovery that
the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the
20th century.”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Qur’aan mentioned the expansion of the universe, before man even learnt
to build a telescope! Some may say that the presence of astronomical facts in
the Qur’aan is not surprising since the Arabs were advanced in the field of
astronomy. They are correct in acknowledging the advancement of the Arabs
in the field of astronomy. However they fail to realize that the Qur’aan was
revealed centuries before the Arabs excelled in astronomy. Moreover many of
the scientific facts mentioned above regarding astronomy, such as the origin
of the universe with a Big Bang, were not known to the Arabs even at the
peak of their scientific advancement. The scientific facts mentioned in the
Qur’aan are therefore not due to the Arabs’ advancement in astronomy.
Indeed, the reverse is true. The Arabs advanced in astronomy, because
astronomy occupies a place in the Qur’aan.</center></p>

          <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:400">THE LIGHT OF THE MOON IS REFLECTED LIGHT</h2>
          
<p><center>
It was believed by earlier civilizations that the moon emanates its own light.
Science now tells us that the light of the moon is reflected light. However this
fact was mentioned in the Qur’aan 1,400 years ago in the following verse:.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
“Blessed is He Who made Constellations in the skies, And placed therein
a Lamp And a Moon giving light.” [Al-Qur’aan 25:61] </b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Arabic word for the sun in the Qur’aan, is shams. It is referred to as
siraaj, which means a ‘torch’ or as wahhaaj which means ‘a blazing lamp’ or
as diya which means ‘shining glory’. All three descriptions are appropriate to
the sun, since it generates intense heat and light by its internal combustion.
The Arabic word for the moon is qamar and it is described in the Qur’aan as
muneer, which is a body that gives nur i.e. light. Again, the Qur’aanic
description matches perfectly with the true nature of the moon, which does
not give off light itself and is an inert body that reflects the light of the sun.
Not once in the Qur’aan, is the moon mentioned as siraaj, wahhaaj or diya or
the sun as nur or muneer. This implies that the Qur’aan recognizes the
difference between the nature of sunlight and moonlight.
